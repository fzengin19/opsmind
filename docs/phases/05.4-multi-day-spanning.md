# Phase 5.4: Connected Multi-Day Events

## Goal
Display multi-day events as a visually continuous bar across the Month View grid, without overhauling the grid architecture. We will strictly use CSS and smart data preparation to achieve this "Connected" look.

## 1. Backend: Intelligent Data Distribution (`CalendarService.php`)
The `getAppointmentsForMonth` method currently puts an appointment only in its start date's bucket.
We will change this to:
1.  **Iterate Days:** Loop through every day of the event's duration (within the current view).
2.  **Inject Metadata:** For each day, add the event to that day's array with a `position` flag:
    -   `single`: Starts and ends on this day.
    -   `start`: Starts on this day, continues tomorrow.
    -   `middle`: Started before today, continues tomorrow.
    -   `end`: Started before today, ends today.

## 2. Frontend: CSS Optical Illusion (`index.blade.php`)
We will use the `position` metadata to apply specific Tailwind classes that remove borders/margins between connected days.

| Position | Visual Style | Tailwind Classes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `single` | Rounded all corners | `rounded mx-1` |
| `start` | Rounded Left, Flat Right | `rounded-l rounded-r-none mr-0 pr-2` |
| `middle` | Flat Left, Flat Right | `rounded-none mx-0 px-2` |
| `end` | Flat Left, Rounded Right | `rounded-l-none rounded-r ml-0 pl-2` |

*Note: We might need negative margins (`-mx-px`) to ensure perfect pixel touching if there are grid gaps.*

## 3. Verification
-   Create a 3-day event.
-   Verify it appears in all 3 days.
-   Verify the corners look connected (Left-Rounded ... Flat ... Right-Rounded).
