# Hi, I'm Fatih 👋

I'm a **Fullstack Developer** specialized in **Backend Architecture**.

While I handle the full lifecycle of web applications (frontend included), my main focus is designing systems that don't turn into spaghetti code after a few months.

I come from a **C#** background, where I learned the importance of strict N-Tier architecture and Clean Code principles. Today, I apply that same structured mindset to **PHP & Laravel** to build maintainable software.

I also enjoy managing my own infrastructure—setting up Linux servers and handling deployments is part of the process for me.

### 🔭 Selected Repositories

**[laravel-approval](https://github.com/fzengin19/laravel-approval)**
A dedicated Laravel package I built to handle approval workflows. It encapsulates the approval logic into a reusable component, keeping the main business logic clean.

**[SwallowPHP](https://github.com/fzengin19/swallow-php)**
This is my playground. I'm building a custom framework from scratch—not to replace Laravel, but to reverse-engineer it. It helps me understand how things like Dependency Injection and Routing actually work under the hood.
